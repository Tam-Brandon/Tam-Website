<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Hello, I'm Tom and the owner of Tom's Small Engine Repairs.<br>
  My garage is located north of the Twin Cities metro area in Fridley, Minnesota.<br>
  Service can be drop-in and drop-off or a pick up delivery can be arranged.<br>
  I've worked on small engines for 20 years and am very familiar with most models.
</p>


<h3>Services</h3>

<p>I service all makes and models.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Lawn mowers</li>
      <li>snow blowers</li>
      <li>generators</li>
      <li>scooters</li>
      <li>ATVs</li>
      <li>and other small engines</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Price Estimate</h3>
  <p>Please call for an accurate estimate, but I can assure you that it'll be cheaper than my competitors.<br>
    No repair will be more than $500 because at that price, you mind as well buy a new engine.
  </p>

<h3>Pick Up and Delivery!</h3>

<p>I offer a pick up and delivery service throughout the Twin Cities. Max distance of 30 miles.<br>
Please call for details on the rates.</p>
